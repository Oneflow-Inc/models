# Wide&Deep
[Wide&Deep](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html) is an industrial application model for CTR recommendation that combines Deep Neural Network and Linear model. Its model structure is as follows. Based on this structure, this project uses OneFlow distributed deep learning framework to realize training the modle in graph mode and eager mode respectively on Crioteo data set.

## Prepare running
### Environment
Running Wide&Deep model requires downloading [OneFlow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) for caculating mertics, and tool package [numpy](https://numpy.org/)。


### Dataset
[Criteo](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Kaggle_Display_Advertising_Challenge_dataset/5732310) dataset is the online advertising dataset published by criteo labs. It contains the function value and click feedback of millions of display advertisements, which can be used as the benchmark for CTR prediction. Each advertisement has the function of describing data. The dataset has 40 attributes. The first attribute is the label, where a value of 1 indicates that the advertisement has been clicked and a value of 0 indicates that the advertisement has not been clicked. This attribute contains 13 integer columns and 26 category columns.

### Prepare ofrecord format data 
Please view [how_to_make_ofrecord_for_wdl](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/OneFlow-Benchmark/blob/master/ClickThroughRate/WideDeepLearning/how_to_make_ofrecord_for_wdl.md)
