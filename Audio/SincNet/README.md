# SincNet with oneflow

Implementation of [SincNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00158) with Oneflow.

SincNet is a neural architecture for processing **raw audio samples**. It is a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encourages the first convolutional layer to discover more **meaningful filters**. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which implement band-pass filters.

In contrast to standard CNNs, that learn all elements of each filter, only low and high cutoff frequencies are directly learned from data with the proposed method. This offers a very compact and efficient way to derive a **customized filter bank** specifically tuned for the desired application. 


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- oneflow 0.5.0
- pysoundfile


## Datasets

We use the TIMIT dataset to train the model. However, the code can be easily adapted to any speech dataset.

`utils/TIMIT_preparation.py` contains scripts to process TIMIT dataset into features compatible with SincNet.

This file receives three parameters, $TIMIT_FOLDER„ÄÅ$DATA_PREPARED and $LABEL. *$TIMIT_FOLDER* is the folder of the original TIMIT corpus. *$OUTPUT_FOLDER* is the folder in which the preprocessed TIMIT will be stored. *$LABEL* is the list of the TIMIT files used for training/test the speaker id system.


## Train

```bash
bash train.sh
```


## Infer
