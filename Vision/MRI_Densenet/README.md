# MRI_Densenet

### Description

The objective is to create a network that can take a low-resolution MRI scan and turn it into a super resolution scan.

### Dataset

The dataset is a large and publicly accessible brain structural MRI database called Human Connectome Project (HCP): [https://www.humanconnectomeproject.org](https://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/). The data contains 3D T1-weighted images from a total of 1,113 subjects that were acquired via a Siemens 3T platform using 32-channel head coils on multiple centers. The images come in high spatial resolution as 0.7 mm isotropic in a matrix size of 256x320x320. You need to register and log in the website: [https://db.humanconnectome.org](https://db.humanconnectome.org/). You can either download full dataset from that website or request access to their Amazon S3.
